# Inventory of podcast elements

The genre of podcast I decided to study was comedy. The first set of podcasts I decided to listen to was from Readysetcomedy.libsyn.com. This is a podcast I found from the comments of a pornographic video (I am not kidding) and I decided to give it a listen. The first podcast I listened to was Greatness Comes From Nothing, their introductory podcast. I also listened to sequential podcasts such as Awkward Handy and Experience This Joe Rogan, and have included the structure of these podcasts below. The two hosts of the show work to establish rapport through a series of awkwardly timed introductions and phallus jokes, but ultimately their chemistry shined through and made the podcast enjoyable. After establishing themselves, they progressed into a Q&A series where they stated, “we know so little about everything in the world, we are probably the least qualified individuals to help you with your problems, but we have nothing better to do so buckle up buckaroo’.” The first problem posed is, “You can tell you wife is pregnant, but you had a vasectomy. How do you get proof without directly asking her before she can take action?” After breaking down the problem, the duo worked to answer the question in the least efficient manner possible. Michael proposes to make the wife laugh at a joke and then tickle her until she pee’s herself, then to ring out her pee into a cup and “look for babies” while Nick proposes that the viewer should look for a burner phone and see if she has told the baby daddy that he is a baby daddy. Overall, the podcast was funny and I enjoyed listened to two idiots who seemed like they would make great 3:00 AM Saturday companions. A detailed breakdown of their podcasts is below:

Introduce viewers to show while conveying the humor displayed on podcast:

Nick: A lot of advice podcasts have a niche but I digress, and I do not know what digress means Michael: it is the opposite of egress
Nick: Anyway, the fact that most podcasts are experts in cars or relationship advice or whatever, WE are equally qualified for every question you might have because were experts of nothing
Michael: Exactly because we literately have no expertise, anything you can think of right know we don’t know shit about.
Nick: No matter what your question is, were going to be able to answer it just the same, iron clad answers.

- Provide background on podcast hosts
•	Michael and Nick are two thirty year old friend
•	Known each other for a long time (oldest set of best friends)
•	Establish their lack of knowledge

- Talk about dead air and how to deal with it (fill it with phallus jokes)

- Little to no emphasis on sound effects that are not made by their mouths on the spot
•	Sound effects included the whizzing of air out of mouths
•	Fart noises
•	Subtle quacking

- Laugh a lot at everything

- Build off each other’s jokes and energy

- Create a plot of some sort, in this case helping listeners with problems
•	State problem viewer faces
•	Make fun of viewer for having this problem
•	Realize they know nothing about the subject
•	Run in circled until some idea has been created out of thin air

- Have fun

## The second podcast

The second podcast I decided to listen to was also a comedy-based podcast. This time I went with a much more popular and funded podcast, professorblastoff.com. I found this podcast to be much funnier as the hosts were seasoned veterans and the production value allowed for a professionally produced cast. A brief synopsis is provided here courtesy of iTunes: This show is a weekly conversation between Tig Notaro and her co-hosts Kyle Dunnigan and David Huntsberger, in which they focus on a central theme they find interesting. The episode I listened to today was the 100th Episode of their series. In this, they talked about clothing and some science stuff (atoms, noble gases, and the periodic table). The topics range from scientific to philosophical to metaphysical. I myself am a Chemistry major and a STEM oriented person. I enjoyed this podcast because the hosts found a way to intertwine humor with science. There was a nice charm to this type of podcast. I learned a lot from this and I will include the structure below:

The podcast began with a rocket ship blasting off and a bunch of sound effects to set the mood.

-The hosts of the show briefly establish rapport and set the mood to come while addressing questions from the previous episodes comments
•	Posed question to each member of the panel and let them answer
•	Interjecting with sound effects when possible
•	Summarizes interactions at end of question

- Hosts say a witty one-liner and use a soundboard to enhance the delivery of the joke

- Hosts talk about daily life interactions in a joking way
•	Relates information back to the original subject
•	Tries to add multiple perspectives and brings in experts
•	Always keeps an educational yet funny undertone

- Guests are brought in for comedic relief

- This video also has a Q&A segment in which the hosts answer in a half-serious way

- Hosts wrap up show making fun of each other while keeping the tone light

Both of these podcasts are aimed at those who want to laugh, but the latter has a more scientific approach. It is interesting to analyze the structure of each show as they have many things in common, but are such different shows.
